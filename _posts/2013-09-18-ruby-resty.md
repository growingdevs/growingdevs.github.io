I spend a lot of my time working with REST APIs. At home, at work, at
hackathons, it's GET this and POST that. [Resty][1] is an amazing tool to
simplify sending multiple HTTP requests with the same data and headers. My
favorite part is having per-host configuration so you never have to worry about
remembering your cryptic, hashed API keys and header names.

It's such a great tool, except resty currently [doesn't work in zsh][3].

After thinking about it, a shell script isn't the best approach for community development. Coming from a
Ruby background, shell script syntax is so _hard to read_. What about adding functionality to Resty? 
Can I add a new command that Resty supports? Can I have nice tests documenting functionality? 
How about some continuous integration?

And I embarked on a [Ruby Port of Resty][7].

What started as a straight port, morphed into something I didn't expect.

I started a spike with my own REPL. Thinking more about features,
I realized I should be using something like the superb [Pry][4]. Pry allows Ruby Resty to be 
easily extensible with it's [Custom Command][5] infrastructure. Since we're using plain ol' Ruby,
we should use plain old ruby objects!

<pre><code class="language-ruby">POST /api/nyan {"name": "grumpy"} # JSON String
POST /api/nyan {name: "grumpy"}   # Ruby Hash
POST /api/nyan data               # User assigned variable in the REPL
</code></pre>

Pretty nifty.

One way Ruby Resty differs from Resty is host aliasing. Rather than specifiying a hostname, 
which maps to the config file, users can specify an easy to remember alias defined in ~/.ruby_resty.yml.

This is still a working in progress and I would love some feedback. If you're interested,
submit a [ruby-resty][7] issue or reply to this post.
