Welcome to Growing Devs. This is a blog for a group of devs to share their
experiences – through writing and through code – in growing software,
themselves, and other developers. Or, just to write about any nerdy thing
we want to write about.

The group is fluid. Some devs will write only once, and we hope that new devs
will join and write. All editorial review and publishing is handled through
GitHub pull requests.

This is an experiment for us. But we think it has merit. In particular, we
think this format has the benefits of:

* inspiring and challenging us to write
* sharing the burden of editorial work
* sharing success, recognition, and pagerank
* not binding us to a single language, topic, or company
* providing space to share content, without maintaining a solo blog

You can follow our [RSS feed](http://growingdevs.com/feed.xml), [follow us
on Twitter @growingdevs](http://twitter.com/growingdevs), or we would love for you
to [contribute](https://github.com/growingdevs/growingdevs.github.io).

The site is open source under the MIT license, all content is copyright of the
original authors and not of Growing Devs (which is not really an organization
of any kind anyway).

Thanks for visiting, we look forward to sharing some new and wonderful content
in this experiment of ours!

And again, if you would like to contribute a blog post you've had in the back
of your head for days or months, please feel encouraged to send us a pull
request.
